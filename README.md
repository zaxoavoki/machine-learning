# Machine Learning Examples

Here I'm trying to build different algorithms of machine learning from scratch.

List of algorithms and models:

 - K-Nearest Neighbors
 - Naive Bayes
 - Linear Regression model (simple and multiple too)
 - Logistic Regression (with Gradient Descent)

P.S. You can find more information inside each Jupyter Notebook.
