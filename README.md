# Machine Learning Basic Examples

Here I'm using different algorithms of machine learning with libraries such as Tensorflow, NumPy and others.

List of algorithms and models:

- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
- Linear Regression model (simple and multiple too)
- Logistic Regression (with Gradient Descent)
- Neural Networks

You can find more information inside each Jupyter Notebook.
